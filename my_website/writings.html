    <h2>Salamano<br>
<br>
He paraded the streets of Paris with a shaggy dog at his flank.<br>
The last clumps of its hair like patches of dotted shrubbery.<br>
Beast and master riddled with age.<br>
Their legs stiffened. Their skin sank.<br>
<br>
And at each step his gnarled oaken staff would clunk as it cradled old bones.<br>
And listen patiently to mutterings of better days, when life offered more.<br>
More than a tired old beast,<br>
Whose beady eyes would make one groan.<br>
<br>
They shared a room together, a musty hell too small for two.<br>
The public mutterings became here raging fits.<br>
The calm staff now swung and thrown.<br>
Flecks of sour bile spraying as his fists flew.<br>
<br>
Strikes aimed at the whimpering source of his sorrow: the beast would pay.<br>
Pay for the disgust it bestowed upon its chief onlooker.<br>
“For it is a privileged creature,<br>
What other unsatisfied master would let it stay?”<br>
<br>
Justice was delivered each night, in retribution to its crimes.<br>
Leaving more and more scarred the unlovable sinner.<br>
And a heaving, unregretful castigator,<br>
Content with his handiwork each time.<br>
<br>
And then it was gone, leaving only the bloody trails of a dragging paw.<br>
“Filthy cur! Shameful mutt! Disgusting cumbersome creature of Hell!”<br>
In his furor, the staff whipped and whizzed.<br>
But there was no one to hit. No victim for law.<br>
<br>
And when blood boiled down to a bubble, and evening darkened the sky,<br>
His hands reached by nature for staff and leash.<br>
But there was no one to walk with.<br>
When realization dawned, he began to cry.<br>
<br>
Now the memories came to him. First of the funeral.<br>
Then visions of a newly widowed man lifting a boisterous pup.<br>
She reminded him of his wife.<br>
A leaping ball of fur which rendered sorrow null.<br>
<br>
A rich coat of gleaming brown, stalwart by its handsome master.<br>
The talk of the town. The center of attention on every stroll.<br>
They grew old together.<br>
As time passed, the skin shed faster.<br>
<br>
No love could protect against bitterness and complacency.<br>
Oaken staff more twisted. Once-groomed paws more blistered.<br>
We forget what makes us happy<br>
Until there’s a vacancy.<br>
<br>
