    <h2>Quarter 1 Review<h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Q: What was the most interesting project?<h2>
<br>
    <h2>A: Definitely the flowchart project. It had a great creative element.<h2>
<br>
    <h2>Q: What was the hardest to write.<h2>
<br>
    <h2>A: I'd say the mastermind project had the most complex code.
    It required a lot of "moving pieces" and variables to keep track of and incorporate.
    Also, it was quite a challenge formatting everything so that numbers and rows of guesses
    lined up evenly.<h2>
<br>
    <h2>Q: What was the most creative?<h2>
<br>
    <h2>A: The flowchart project spurred my creative juices most. With respect to the code,
    we found creative ways of representing gamestates as a class, such that situations could
    loop back on themselves. Writing the story, and creating the background story of our world
    required a second dimension of creativity.<h2>
