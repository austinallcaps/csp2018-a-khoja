    <h2>Quarter 1 Review<h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Q: What was the most interesting project?<h2>
<br>
    <h2>A: Definitely the flowchart project. It had a great creative element.<h2>
<br>
    <h2>Q: What was the hardest to write.<h2>
<br>
    <h2>A: I'd say the mastermind project had the most complex code.
    It required a lot of "moving pieces" and variables to keep track of and incorporate.
    Also, it was quite a challenge formatting everything so that numbers and rows of guesses
    lined up evenly.<h2>
<br>
    <h2>Q: What was the most creative?<h2>
<br>
    <h2>A: The flowchart project spurred my creative juices most. With respect to the code,
    we found creative ways of representing gamestates as a class, such that situations could
    loop back on themselves. Writing the story, and creating the background story of our world
    required a second dimension of creativity.<h2>

<h2>Data Analysis<h2><br>
<h2>Question: how frequently are the most common words in YouTube comments used compared to their use in common speech?<h2>
<img src="images/Results.png" height="650">
<br>
<h2>The top 10 most used words in a random selection of 1000
YT comments chosen randomly from the top 5 trending YT video. Each word in each
selected comment was cross-referenced with a list of all English words. The
frequencies of use of the top 10 most used words were plotted in blue on a
logarithmic scale. In green, word frequency data from
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp?s=y">here</a> was used to plot
the common-use frequency of each word for comparison.<h2>
<br>
<h2>Answer: the most notable result was that words like "I" and "you" were used incredibly more often within YT
comments compared to common use. Our hypothesis explaining this phenomenon was that YT comments should tend to be
much more opinionated and personal statements of the commenter's opinion towards the video-maker.<h2>
